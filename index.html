I just want to make a change in the world.
It doesn't haft to be making world peace, it doesnt haft to be solving world hunger.
I just want to do somthing or even just make somthing that came stop somone for atleast one more day.
When like gets tough we make impulsive decisions we will regret later.
If I can just make something that can atleast stop a person from doing somthing that will hurt the people they love, thats enough for me.
I know those feelings, unfortatly I'm very familar with them.
But if I can atleast get even a small group of people to not act on those thoughts, I would have completed my life goal.
